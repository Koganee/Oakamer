I am currently studying Computer Science and Software Engineering at Maynooth University, and in my free time I enjoy developing personal projects in Java and Python, as well as learning new technologies.

At the moment I have a major interest in machine learning, so am working on a project that is a combination of that and my passion for football.

Also develop minecraft mods and am learning React with a web app for tracking game progress.
